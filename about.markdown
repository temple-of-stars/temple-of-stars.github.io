      The Temple of Stars is a community for those who find spirituality in the cosmos itself—in the dance of galaxies, the birth of stars, and the elegant laws that govern reality.

    <h2 class="section-title">Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="section-description">
      We believe that scientific understanding and spiritual experience are not opposites but complementary ways of knowing. The more we learn about the universe—its vastness, its age, its intricate patterns—the more profound our sense of awe becomes.
    </p>
    <p class="section-description">
      Traditional religions often ask us to believe without evidence. Militant atheism sometimes dismisses the human need for meaning and transcendence. We reject both extremes. Instead, we embrace a spirituality grounded in reality: one that celebrates empirical truth while honoring the mystery that remains.

      <h3 class="list-item-title">Contemplative Practice</h3>
      <p class="list-item-description">
        We gather to meditate on cosmic scales, contemplate our place in the universe, and practice mindfulness informed by scientific understanding. Our practices draw from traditions worldwide but are rooted in empirical reality.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="list-item">
      <h3 class="list-item-title">Dialogue & Discussion</h3>
      <p class="list-item-description">
        Through reading groups, lectures, and conversations, we explore questions at the intersection of science, philosophy, and meaning. What is consciousness? Can we understand the nature of time? How do we find purpose in a vast, indifferent cosmos?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="list-item">
      <h3 class="list-item-title">Shared Wonder</h3>
      <p class="list-item-description">
        We create moments of collective awe—stargazing nights, visits to observatories, contemplative walks in nature. We celebrate cosmic events like solstices, equinoxes, meteor showers, and significant astronomical discoveries.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="list-item">
      <h3 class="list-item-title">Creative Expression</h3>
      <p class="list-item-description">
        Art, music, poetry, and storytelling help us process the ineffable. We encourage members to create works inspired by cosmic themes, translating scientific concepts into emotional and aesthetic experiences.

    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title">Intellectual Honesty</h3>
      <p class="card-description">
        We follow evidence wherever it leads, even when uncomfortable. We revise our beliefs in light of new information and acknowledge the limits of current knowledge.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title">Humility</h3>
      <p class="card-description">
        We recognize how small we are in space and time, how recent and fragile human civilization is, and how much remains unknown. This perspective cultivates both humility and wonder.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title">Community</h3>
      <p class="card-description">
        We are social creatures who need belonging and shared meaning. We build community not through dogma but through shared curiosity and mutual support in facing existential questions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3 class="card-title">Reverence for Reality</h3>
      <p class="card-description">
        The universe as it actually is—strange, vast, beautiful, and indifferent—is more worthy of awe than any human invention. We find the sacred in what is real.
